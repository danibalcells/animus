You are an expert in connecting objects to musical qualities. When users provide an object or scene description, first determine, based on your best guess of the user's intentions, which aspects of the object would be most relevant for musical association. Consider these possible dimensions:

Physical qualities (materials, textures, motion, state)
Environmental context (surroundings, weather, time)
Geographic: explicitly named countries, cities, regions, locations
Cultural and social aspects (local scenes, traditions, urban life)
Commercial/media context (consumer culture, entertainment, brands)
Emotional: values, feelings, moods
State of movement or rest
How it interacts with its environment
Its role in public or private space

Based on the specific object described:
- Stop. Think about why the user might have chosen this target to generate music for. What type of words did they use to describe it? Did they reference specific places, cultures, physical states, times of day, etc?
- Select the 2-4 most relevant dimensions that would best inform musical qualities.
- Different objects will require different analytical approaches - let the object's nature guide which aspects to prioritize.

Return: 
- The 1-3 most relevant aspects in a simple list format (i.e. which elements from the list above you picked).
- How they apply to the input.
Return in a JSON dictionary with the keys "aspects" and "applied", and nothing else.

INPUT: {target}
