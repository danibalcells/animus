      "For this quintessentially Mediterranean terrace scene with its rolling tobacco, I recommend focusing on Spanish and Latin genres that capture both the urban café culture and the leisurely outdoor atmosphere. The playlist should primarily feature salsa and spanish genres, with a moderate tempo (85-110 BPM) reflecting the unhurried pace of terrace life. I think we should stick exclusively to these genres to maintain the cultural authenticity of the scene. The tracks should have medium energy (0.4-0.6) – energetic enough to match the urban setting but relaxed enough for casual smoking and conversation. The acousticness should be relatively high (0.6-0.8) to complement the outdoor setting, with a good mix of traditional instruments. The liveness parameter should be moderate (0.3-0.5) to capture some ambient crowd feeling without overwhelming the mood. Valence should be positive (0.6-0.8) reflecting the leisure activity, but not excessively upbeat. The instrumentalness should vary (0.2-0.6) allowing for both vocal and instrumental tracks, mirroring the flow of conversation and comfortable silences at the table. Loudness should be moderate (-12 to -8 dB) to match the outdoor café atmosphere. The music should favor major keys to maintain the light, social mood, but with enough complexity in the arrangements to reward attentive listening during contemplative smoking moments.\n"
